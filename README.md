### Hi there 👋

I'm a physics engineer with an emphasis on the theoretical and computational branch! Throughout my undergraduate and graduate years I developed a huge interest in multiscale modeling and simulation. My research interests rely on the study of magnetocaloric properties of ceramic and metal alloys for energy applications. 

You can find more about me at [miguelangelooscardoso.github.io](miguelangelooscardoso.github.io)!
